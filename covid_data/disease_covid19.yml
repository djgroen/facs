# Summary of evidence:
# 1: 11.2% secondary attack rate in house holds: 1.112^(1/8.5)=1.012568 -> 1.2568% infection chance per day.
# We assume that 20% of the time is spent within 2 meters in the household -> 1.2568% / 20% = 6.284% or 0.06284

# This paper reports a peak value of R ~ 8 among the crew of the Diamond Princess (who are probably subject to similar confinement levels).
# Deriving from that: 8**(1 / 8.5)= 1.277 -> infection rate of 0.277 in a heavily confined cruiseship setting with little precautions and awareness.
# 13.8% secondary attack rate in house holds: 1.138^(1/8.5)= 1.015325 -> 1.5325% infections chance per day.
# We assume that 20% of the time is spent within 2 meters in the household -> 1.5325% / 20% = 7.6625% or 0.076625

# NOTE: Here the 8.5 days value indicates the generational period of COVID, i.e. the average time point (after time of infection) where an infected person would be infecting someone else.
